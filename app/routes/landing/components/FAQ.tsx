              Digital badges are verifiable credentials that represent skills, achievements,
              or competencies. Each badge contains metadata about what was earned, who issued it,
              and the criteria required. Recipients can share badges on social media, embed them
              in resumes, or add them to digital portfolios. Anyone can verify a badge&apos;s
              authenticity with a single click.

              When you issue a badge, recipients receive an email notification with a link
              to claim their credential. They can then share it directly to LinkedIn, Twitter,
              or Facebook, download the badge image, or get an embed code for their website
              or portfolio. All sharing options include verification links.
