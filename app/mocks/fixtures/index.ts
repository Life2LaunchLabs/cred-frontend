/**
 * Mock Fixtures (Development/Testing Data)
 *
 * This directory contains static mock data for development and testing.
 * When importing MUI templates with mock data (like crud-dashboard),
 * place their data files here.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This data is for development only.
 * - Templates may import directly from fixtures during initial setup
 * - Once MSW is configured, fixtures feed into MSW handlers
 * - In production, these are never used
 *
 * Template data to migrate here:
 * - crud-dashboard/data/employees.ts -> fixtures/employees.ts
 * - dashboard/internals/data/gridData.tsx -> fixtures/gridData.ts
 */

// Export fixtures here as they are added
// Example: export { employees } from './employees';
// Example: export { gridData } from './gridData';
