 * Shared Hooks
 *
 * This directory contains reusable React hooks.
 * When importing from MUI templates (e.g., crud-dashboard), place hooks here.

 * Template hooks to integrate:
 * - useDialogs   - Dialog/modal management (from crud-dashboard/hooks/useDialogs)
 * - useNotifications - Toast/snackbar notifications (from crud-dashboard/hooks/useNotifications)
 */

// Export hooks here as they are added
// Example: export { useDialogs } from './useDialogs';
// Example: export { useNotifications } from './useNotifications';
